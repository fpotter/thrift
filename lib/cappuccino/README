Installing
==========

Run "jake install" to copy the Thrift framework to your
local narwhal packages directory (usually ~/narwhal/packages).


Using Thrift with your Cappuccino Application
=============================================

To copy the framework to your project's directory, run the
following in your project's directory:

  capp gen -f -F thrift .
  
NOTE: You'll see "Warning: Couldn't find debug framework Thrift"
which you can safely ignore.

For an example of usage, see the cappuccino tutorial under
'tutorial/cappuccino'.


Server Requirements
===================

Because Javascript has no support for binary data types, the
included THTTPTransport expects to communicate via url-safe
base64 (see: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64#URL_applications)

THTTPTransport will send the URL parameter base64=true so the
server knows it should decode the request with base64 and 
encode the response with base64.

Existing Thrift HTTP servers will have to be slightly modified
to accommodate this.  For an example server, see 'server.rb' 
under 'tutorial/cappuccino'.
